The mathematician Benoit Mandelbrot invented the field of fractal geometry after considering the coastline paradox. 

In this assignment, I approximate the rough circumference of a Mandelbrot Set fractal using function approximation. I proceed as follows:

• write a function computing the fractal

• use the bisection algorithm to approximate the boundary of the fractal

• use polynomial function approximation to find boundary as a function

• integrate the boundary curve to find its length
